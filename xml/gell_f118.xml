            <ab>The sea rages so violently against the walls 
               as to have destroyed a sentry box at the 
               angle of a bastion. The houses very damp 
               the air being filled with the spray even 
               when there is not any wind. The fortification 
               toward the isthmus strong &amp; not wide. 
               The isthmus occupied by a road on each side 
               of which seats of marble &amp; beyond these 
               gardens. The road is perfectly straight for 
               some miles. A new cut is now making 
               about a cannonshot from the city from 
               the sea to the port, by way of defences 
               the whole island being only separated from 
               the terra firma <note type="translation">dry land</note> by a narrow channel 
               in some places not deep at low water 
               though dangerously muddy. There is a 
               bridge over it. It is said 25 000 men would 
               be necessary to defend the whole. The two
